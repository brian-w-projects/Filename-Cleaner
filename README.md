# filename_cleaner
Small java program to rename files to match folder name. Great for renaming pictures.

This small project was designed to allow for quick mass renaming of files inside of a folder. It is great for renaming images to match the folder representing the named event.

The project uses a number of Java 8 features including streams and the NIO library. I also utilized the builder pattern for creating the core ImageOrganizer object. This allows for more simple construction by the end user and for future flexibility in adding additional features.

See main for examples on how to run the program.
